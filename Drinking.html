			<p>
				An alcoholic drink (or alcoholic beverage) is a drink that contains ethanol, a type of alcohol
				produced by fermentation of grains, fruits, or other sources of sugar. 
				The consumption of alcohol plays an important social role in many cultures. 
				Most countries have laws regulating the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
				Some countries ban such activities entirely, but alcoholic drinks are legal in most parts of 
				the world. The global alcoholic drink industry exceeded $1 trillion in 2018.
