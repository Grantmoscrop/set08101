		<h1> Hobby number 2</h1>
		<h2> Playing video games</h2>
		
		<p>
			A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate
			visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional video display device such as a touchscreen, virtual
			reality headset or monitor/TV set. Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly 
			important part of the entertainment industry, and whether they are also a form of art is a matter 
			of dispute.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The electronic systems used to play video games are called platforms. Video games are developed 
			and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms
			such as arcade games, which present the game in a large, typically coin-operated chassis, were 
			common in the 1980s in video arcades, but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms
			became available. These include dedicated devices such as video game consoles, as well as 
			general-purpose computers like a laptop, desktop or handheld computing devices.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The input device used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common controllers 
			include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, or even
			a person's body, using a Kinect sensor. Players view the game on a display device such as a 
			television or computer monitor or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. 
			There are often game sound effects, music and voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or
			headphones. Some games in the 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback 
			peripherals and virtual reality headsets.
